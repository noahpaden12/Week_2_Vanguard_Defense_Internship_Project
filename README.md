# Week_2_Vanguard_Defense_Internship_Project
HUVTSP 2025, Session 1, Week 2, Internship Project with Vanguard Defense (technical-track).

Objective: In the technical track, students won’t just learn about AI—they’ll build the infrastructure that powers it. Over five weeks, interns will develop a full-stack data annotation webapp tailored for real-world defense applications. Students will design a sleek, functional interface (with tools like Streamlit or Gradio) where users can tag tanks, trace terrain, and label objects that matter.
Once the dataset is built, students load pre-trained vision models like YOLOv8, run inference on their hand-labeled data, and compare model predictions against human judgment. Some results will be accurate. Others will miss the mark. That’s the point. Students will see, firsthand, where AI stumbles, and how thoughtful data labeling and UI tweaks can push performance forward. By the end, each team will have built a working product, shipped a clean dataset, and reflected deeply on the interface between machine intelligence and human oversight. Students will walk away not just with code, but with insight and a real-world sense of how critical data infrastructure shapes the future of autonomous systems.
