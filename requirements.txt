Objectives:

During Week 2, you will transform the datasets chosen in Week 1 into a working browser‑based 
annotation tool. By Friday, interns will demo a prototype that supports drawing bounding boxes 
(or polygons) on images and exporting labels in a standard JSON format, laying the groundwork 
for model training later. 

1.  Stand up a lightweight web app (Streamlit, Gradio, or Flask). 
2.  Implement core annotation widgets (rectangle, polygon, class dropdown). 
3.  Persist annotations locally (COCO‑style JSON) with versioned saves. 
4.  Practice modular Python structure and peer code review on GitHub. 
5.  Present a live demo and explain technical design decisions.

Make Sure to Have:

1. GitHub Repo Updates containing:  
  app.py or equivalent main file.  
  requirements.txt.  
  annotation_schema.json (example COCO format).  
  docs/ folder with setup guide (README_prototype.md). 
2.  Live Demo Link (Streamlit‑share URL or public Replit/HF Space). 
3.  Short Demo Video (≤ 90 s) showing labeling flow & JSON export. 
4.  Mini Slide Deck (4 slides): Architecture, UI snapshot, JSON example, next steps
