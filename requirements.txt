Objectives:

During Week 2, you will transform the datasets chosen in Week 1 into a working browser‑based 
annotation tool. By Friday, interns will demo a prototype that supports drawing bounding boxes 
(or polygons) on images and exporting labels in a standard JSON format, laying the groundwork 
for model training later. 

1.  Stand up a lightweight web app (Streamlit, Gradio, or Flask). 
2.  Implement core annotation widgets (rectangle, polygon, class dropdown). 
3.  Persist annotations locally (COCO‑style JSON) with versioned saves. 
4.  Practice modular Python structure and peer code review on GitHub. 
5.  Present a live demo and explain technical design decisions.
